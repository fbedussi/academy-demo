# 3 reasons to switch from redux to redux toolkit

##Â 1 Write less

- No more types-js
- No more action creator for plain action
- Redux-thunk e redux-dev-tools installed by default
- Easiest state updates (no need to recreate the new state by hand)

## 2 Type safety out of the box

- Excelent TS support
- Minimal explicit types required, great inference

## 3 RTK Query

- Separates data fetching/caching from app state
- Handle loading, error, retries, optimistic updates
